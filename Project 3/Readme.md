Make a simple version of Lunar Lander:<br/>
  
The player should fall with gravity (make it very low so it moves slowly).<br/>
Moving left and right should change acceleration instead of velocity.<br/>
If the player touches a wall/rock show text “Mission Failed”<br/>
If the player touches the platform show  text “Mission Successful”<br/> 
You can use whatever graphics/theme as long as you meet the requirements.<br/>

Keyboard Input:<br/>
Start the Game - Space<br/>
Decrease acceleration - Left<br/>
Increase acceleration - Right<br/>
